put pages inside Game struct, enumerating pages once on startup instead of every time we want to write to r/rx sections.

fix seemingly random crashes. sometimes the desired page couldn't be found, othertimes the signature could not be found.
sometimes only the patcher crashes, othertimes it also takes the game down with it.

start implementing the fov option.

start implementing the dragonrot option.
